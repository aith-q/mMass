# mMass3

This is the official repository for mMass3: [mMass](http://www.mmass.org) on Python3.
It is currently highly experimental - much of the UI remains broken amidst updating various dependencies.

For more information please see the official mMass homepage at [www.mmass.org](http://www.mmass.org).  Many thanks to Martin Strohalm for his hard work on the project over many years!

Thank you for your interest, and ... have fun!

## Building from source
mMass3 uses [poetry](python-poetry.org/) as the build system.  To get started, clone the repository.

Ensure all the [dependencies for building wxPython](https://wxpython.org/blog/2017-08-17-builds-for-linux-with-pip/index.html) are installed on your system.  For Fedora GNU/Linux (32), this is currently:
```
python3
python3-devel
gtk3
gtk3-devel
gstreamer1
gstreamer1-devel
freeglut
freeglut-devel
libjpeg-turbo
libjpeg-turbo-devel
libpng
libpng-devel
libtiff
libtiff-devel
SDL
SDL-devel
libnotify
libnotify-devel
libSM
libSM-devel
```

From within the repository, install the dependencies into the _venv_ with:

`poetry install`

Run the software:

`poetry run mmass`
